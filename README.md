# BarkBnbProject

## Project Description

My backend project is currently being built to connect dog owners and sitters on my app. I use Node.js for its speed, and I'm making sure the data is safe. The app is still in progress, but I'm working hard to make it awesome for all dog lovers!

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm start` to start the server

soon this will be a full stack app with a front end
